                My journey into engineering is a long one which began with my fascination for space-travel as a kid.
                This led me to enrol at Queenâ€™s University for <span class="colouredText">mechanical
                    engineering</span> with the goal of becoming an aerospace engineer and developing space crafts.
                As time went on, I became attracted to recent innovations within the tech space such as
                autonomous vehicles, robotics, and the opportunity for further innovation within the same space.
                As someone who also has a love for creation and logical problem-solving,
                I developed an interest in <span class="colouredText">software development</span> where my
                childhood friends and I spent hours trying to create modifications for Minecraft using Java.
                This was the first time I felt the satisfaction of creating a product from just an idea!

            <div class="aboutMeParagraph">
                I then discovered Mechatronics Engineering which seemed like a discipline created for my exact
                combination of interests!
                This led me to the <span class="colouredText">University of Waterloo</span> Where I current study
                <span class="colouredText">Mechatronics Engineering</span>.

                I also have a love for football (where I was intrumural captain at UW), basketball, working out and
                scrolling
                endlessly on instagram.
